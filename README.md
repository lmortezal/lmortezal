## Introduction
I'm a Computer Science student and currently working as a DevOps Engineer. I love working with DevOps, Linux, and programming languages like Go and Python. Through both my professional experience and personal projects, I've gained valuable skills and continue to expand my expertise.

## About Me
I'm passionate about learning and growing in DevOps. I enjoy solving problems and contributing to exciting projects. In my free time, I like exploring new technologies and contributing to open-source projects on GitHub.

Currently, I'm self-studying Golang for DevOps and learning some backend development. I have experience working with deployments, database replication in master-slave mode, and the LEMP stack. I'm also involved with DevOps skills like web servers, containers, Linux, automation, GitLab, and more.

Feel free to reach out for collaborations or discussions on DevOps or Golang. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
